    "In this notebook we will introduce the Quantum Fourier Transform, the analogue of the classical Fourier Transform, that is widely used in physics and maths to transform signals from time or spatial domain to frequency domain. One example of application is, in Computer Vision, to correct images and delete low frequencies, in order to smooth an image that is full of noise."

    "Here, in the Quantum world, we are going to use the Quantum Fourier Transform in other algorithms, so QFT is an essential part of many algorithms such as Shor's Algorithm, or the Phase Estimation algorithm, that we are going to see in other notebooks. However, Quantum Fourier Transformation has the same core, that is to transform from one domain to frequency domain, and we will reach that by applying some transformations over the amplitudes of the signal."

    "The discrete Fourier transform acts on a vector (x0,...,xNâˆ’1) and maps it to another vector (y0, ... , yN-1) according to this formula:  \n",

    "where $\\omega_N^{jk} = e^{2\\pi i \\frac{jk}{N}}$ , a simple rotation of the state over the z axis.  \n",

In Fourier basis, we store the numbers doing rotations along z axis:  \n",

We can also see on the image that all qubits are in |+>, that's why we have to put a Hadamart gate on every qubit. In above example, if we want to encode |5> state, we only have to rotate each qubit, from leftmost to rightmost, by (5/2^n) times. Having 4 qubits as in the example, we will have to do 5/2^4 = 5/16 full turns (5/16 x 2pi radians). The next qubit is rotated double times (10/16 x 2pi radians), and so on... (we only have to double the angle)."

    "Now, to implement the circuit that does the Quantum Fourier Transform, we will use 2 different types of gates. The first one we have introduced it previously, the Hadamart gate, and we will use one new gate: the controlled rotation (CROT) around z-axis, given an angle. We can see a representation of the circuit here:  \n",
