# Quantum Algorithms
 
This repository is about quantum algorithms and their coding in Python, with Qiskit library, a package that allows quantum programming using quantum gates to build circuits that are similar to classical programming, with the analogue form of the classical gates we already know (AND, NOT, XOR...), but with the advantages that give us the quantum computing.  
All this algorithms are explained in more detail in Qiskit tutorial (https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html), from where the information and the figures were extracted.

This repository is for a final grade project of university, with only academical purposes.
